#Banking app

This is a simple app that will allow me to perform certain
tasks with my bank accounts

*  Update transactions with the click of a button
*  Spot patterns and predict future transactions

## open source

Although this project is for me, I'm willing to accept ideas
and contributions if anybody has any worthwhile ideas.

I'm trying to figure out how to work with Jetbrains YouTrack issue tracker
and GitHub at the same time, as I've been using YouTrack for a while now for issues.

## Intended usage
I've created this app for my own use. However, if anybody else finds it useful then have at it.

### Commercial usage
There is no way that I would be comfortable developing this app for commercial use.
That is to say that I would not be comfortable putting this out for other people to use and charging for it.

It would require specific setup for each bank as they all have their own login proceedures.

#### Open Banking
In the United Kingdom, there is a system called Open Banking, where you can get access to bank accounts via an APIs.
This, however, would probably require certification, and many loops to jump through.

## Restricted accounts
I will try, and create this app, so that the accounts, and the login procedures etc are decoupled.
That should mean that a new instance of an account should be able to be just dropped in order to allow access to the accounts.
