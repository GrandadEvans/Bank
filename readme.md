#Banking app

This is a simple app that will allow me to perform certain
tasks with my bank accounts

*  Update transactions with the click of a button
*  Spot patterns and predict future transactions

## open source

Although this project is for me, I'm willing to accept ideas
and contributions if anybody has any worthwhile ideas.

I'm trying to figure out how to work with Jetbrains YouTrack issue tracker
and GitHub at the same time, as I've been using YouTrack for a while now for issues.
